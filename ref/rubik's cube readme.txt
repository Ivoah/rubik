Platform: TI-83+/83+SE/84+/84+SE graphing calculators
Shell: Ion or MirageOS compatible

This a program that simulates a Rubik's Cube puzzle on a graphing calculator. 

You will need to have either an Ion-compatible or a MirageOS-compatible shell on your calculator. Send the appropriate file (either RUBIK (Ion).8xp or RUBIK (MirageOS).8xp) to your calculator. You're ready to start cubing!

The first time you run the program, the cube will start out in a solved state. After that, the state of the cube is saved when you exit the program (with MirageOS, if prgmRUBIK is archived, you will have to enable writeback to archived programs, but that option is enabled by default so you probably don't have anything to worry about).

The arrow keys are used to rotate the cube so you can look at it from different angles. To actually move the cube's layers, you use the number pad: the keys 1-9 represent the front face of the cube, and pressing three of them in order rotates a layer of the cube (for example, 1-2-3 rotates the bottom row layer left; 2-5-8 rotates the middle column layer up). It's fairly intuitive if you think of the motion of twisting a physical cube.

You can also reset or quickly scramble the cube. Hold down MODE for several seconds and the cube will be reset (the 'several seconds' part is so that you don't accidentally press it). Hold down XT?N for several seconds and the cube will be scrambled - this beats randomly shuffling the cube around yourself.

Finally, press CLEAR to exit the program.
