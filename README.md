A rubik's cube game for TI calculators

## Controls
The arrow keys are used to rotate the cube so you can look at it from different angles. To actually move the cube's layers, you use the number pad: the keys 1-9 represent the front face of the cube, and pressing three of them in order rotates a layer of the cube (for example, 1-2-3 rotates the bottom row layer left; 2-5-8 rotates the middle column layer up; 8-9-6 rotates the front face clockwise). It's fairly intuitive if you think of the motion of twisting a physical cube.

You can also reset or quickly scramble the cube. Press MODE and the cube will be reset. Press XTÎ¸n and the cube will be scrambled - this beats randomly shuffling the cube around yourself.

Finally, press CLEAR to exit the program.
